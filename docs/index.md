Welcome to the Blåhaj of Undying documentation. 
This manual is currently up-to-date with version 1.6.0 of BoU. 
Here you will find all the information you’ll need to enjoy Blåhaj of Undying to the fullest.

Blåhaj of Undying is a very basic, yet adorable mod. When installed, 
the default Totem of Undying in vanilla Minecraft is visually replaced by a cute little shark plush. 
(This shark is based on the real life product sold by IKEA, thus the Swedish name Blåhaj meaning blue shark.)

The default totem can be restored however by using a built-in resource pack. 
This will make raw totems dropped by evokers not be a shark by default, but will only convert to one if renamed in an anvil. 
Note that you must use a recognized keyword anywhere in the name for this to work. Please see the [Keywords] page for all accepted keywords.

Looking to customize your plush? Well, you can do that too! By placing your plush/totem in an anvil you can use 
keywords to assign new colors, sizes and characters to your cuddle buddy. To give an example: by renaming your 
plush/totem to “Red Shark”, you will see the blåhaj turns red! Want that same shark to be bigger? 
Then add something like “large” in front. To see the list of all plushies and their accepted keywords, 
please see the [Keywords] page.
