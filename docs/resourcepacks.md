# Resource Packs

The cuddling animation this mod uses is available for 
external resource packs to make use of in their own models.
You can add the `huggable` property to any item model definition to
make it use this custom arm position. 

```json
{
  "huggable": true,
  "parent": ...,
  "textures": {
    ...
  },
  "elements": [
    ...
  ]
}
```
